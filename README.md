How To Use ChatGPT to Apply for Jobs
I just recently graduated college and I found that finding jobs and applying to each of them was a tedious task with little reward. I have been using Chat GPT for a long time to help with college work, a side business, hobbies, and more. Naturally I figured I could use it to help me in my job search as well. I had a plan to have it narrow down jobs so I am applying only to the jobs that I actually have the qualifications for.
## Here are the steps:
1. Take your resume and input it into Chat GPT. (add any accomplishments or certifications. I added my linkedin profile as well to give it all of the information it needs) Say something like this:
2. “Take my resume along with these certifications and my linkedin profile and keep them for the next prompt: (paste here)”
3. Find a section of a job search website (I used Indeed for this) and find your respective category.
4. Copy the webpage from top to bottom. This includes the job name and the company.
5. Type the following into Chat GPT
6. “Using my resume, linkedin, and certifications, make a list of the all of the jobs here but do not include the ones that I have NO chance getting: (paste step 3 here)
7. Go through the list and find the actual listings on Linkedin. Take the first one and copy the entire page that includes the job description and type a new prompt to Chat GPT:
8. “Use the resume and personal analytics provided, tell me if I am eligible for the job description below. Give me a rough % (does not have to be super precise just give me a percent) on how likely I am to get the job based on my info and the requirements in the job description. See job description below: (Paste job description)
9. The output provided by ChatGPT should tell you how you match up with the job requirements, an estimation of your likelihood, and an overall likelihood estimate.
10. You can also ask it to give you recommendations on what you can do to make yourself look better to the company if the analysis gives you a small percentage likelihood. For instance, it would tell me that I need certain certifications or just simply job experience in general.
11. Keep doing this and create an Excel spreadsheet to track progress. Add columns like company name, job title, application date, follow up date, description (I pasted in the link for the job description), status (no reply, applied, expired, not qualified, rejected, accepted), and likelihood %)
Any jobs that require a Cover Letter can be created with ChatGPT as well. Since ChatGPT has all of your information from your resume, it can create a great cover letter for you. Paste in the job description and tell it to create a perfect cover letter for you with all of your information.
